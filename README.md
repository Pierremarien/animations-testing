# Tests on Animations

This is a repository to test some animations to start here i'm using svelte typescript and html canvas. I plan to test using webGPL and webGPU in the future.

## Deployment

Here is the [link](https://stylishanimationmaybe.vercel.app/) to the deployed project!


## Roadmap

- In the process of creating a small particle generator using canvas

- Change the current animation using the particle generator when the ball reaches the line

- Add a navbar to naviguate between the different animation projects 

- remove the ball entierly and make the lines for the arcs appear as the animation 

- let different lengths of those lines appear as a trail depending the arc 

For now this is it but as said in the introduction i want to try more things using canvas wegpl and webgpu so there will be more to come.
